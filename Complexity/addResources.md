Having fun with algorithms
We do not learn algorithms only because we need to study them in college or want to become developers. You can become a better professional by boosting your problem-solving skills using the algorithms you learned in this book as a way of solving problems.

The best way of boosting our knowledge in problem solving is practicing, and practicing does not need to be boring. In this section, we will present some websites that you can go to and start having fun with algorithms (and even earn some cash while doing so!).

Here is a list of some useful websites (some of them do not support sending the problem's solution in JavaScript, but we can apply the logic we discussed in this book to other programming languages as well):

UVa Online Judge (http://uva.onlinejudge.org/): This site contains a set of problems used in several programming contests around the world, including the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), which is sponsored by IBM. (If you are still in college, try to participate in this contest and, if your team wins, you can travel around the world with all expenses paid!) This site contains hundreds of problems in which we can use the algorithms learned in this book.
Sphere Online Judge (http://www.spoj.com/): This site is similar to UVa Online Judge but supports more languages (including JavaScript submissions).
Coder Byte (http://coderbyte.com/): This site contains 74 problems (easy, medium, and hard difficulty) that can also be solved with JavaScript.
Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/): This site contains a series of mathematical/computer programming problems. All you have to do is input the answer to the problem, but we can use algorithms to find the answer for us.
Hacker Rank (https://www.hackerrank.com): This site contains 263 challenges divided into 16 categories (you can use the algorithms that you learned in this book and much more). It also supports JavaScript, among other languages.
Code Chef (http://www.codechef.com/): This site also contains several problems and hosts competitions online.
Top Coder (http://www.topcoder.com/): This site organizes programming tournaments, usually sponsored by companies such as NASA, Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook. Some contests give you the opportunity to work with the sponsoring company, and some contests can give you cash prizes. The website also offers great tutorials for problem solving and algorithms.
Another nice thing about the previous websites is that they usually present a real-world problem, and we need to identify which algorithm we can use to solve this problem. It is a way of knowing that the algorithms we learned in this book are not only educational but can also be applied to solve real-world problems.
